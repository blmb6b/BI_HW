#Problem1 (P1)
Recovers best motif from set of biological sequences using CONSENSUS style algorithm

Input:
    Plaintext FASTA format file containing a header line and multiple lines of
    biological sequences from which to recover motif

How to run:
    - must have Python 3.x installed on machine
    - In command line, navigate to directory containing script and input file
    - use command:
        python Hw2-Q1-1 [input file] [output file] [desired iterations]
    - Output describes sets of randomly selected strings from input file,
        scores for each set
        maximum score and best motif corresponding to that score

#Problem2 (P2)
Computes similarity of two sequences based on their 2-mer composition

Input:
    Plaintext FASTA format file without header line containing two lines each with
    and individual sequence to be compared.

How to run:
    - must have Python 3.x installed on machine
    - In command line, navigate to directory containing script and input file
    - use command:
        python Hw2-Q2-1 [input file] [output file]
    -Score is output in command line as well as to file which, for convenience,
        also contains the sequences that were compared
