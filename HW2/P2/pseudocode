#Pseudocode for solution to problem 2

-Get input
    -Expected input is single file with two sequences, one sequence per line
-Create array of two arrays each filled with string representation of all 2mers for respective sequence
-build dictionary with key for each possible combination of 2 amino acid characters
    -populate value for each key with array [0.0, 0.0] (frequency pair for individual 2mer)
-For each array of 2mers
    -for each 2mer
        -increment corresponding value in dictionary for correct index in frequency pair
-sum = 0
-for each k,v pair in dictionary,
    -if v != 0,0
        -normalize frequency pair by dividing value by number of 2mers in 2mer arrays
        -find baby deltas by reassigning v to abs(pair[0] - pair[1])
        -add baby delta to sum
-print score
